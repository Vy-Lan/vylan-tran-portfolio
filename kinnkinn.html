                      <p class="about-bio">Kinn Kinn (กินน์) is a modern kitchen in Cebu City, Philippines. They focus on providing affordable, accessible, and tasty Thai food.</p>
                      <p class="about-bio">For the restaurant’s launch, they needed a logo, visual identity, and a vertical orientation menu board of Kinn Kinn’s food and beverage offerings. Later on, with the fast approach of their one year in 2025, they wanted to celebrate with some simple, but fun, merch designs.</p>

              <h2 class="project-subhead">Making a memorable first impression</h2>
              <p>The main goal of this project was to create a modern, trendy, and authentic brand logo, style guide, social media assets, and menu design to aid Kinn Kinn’s launch.</p>
          </div>

              <h5 class="project-tags">Logo Design</h5>
              <h2 class="project-subhead">The face of Kinn Kinn</h2>
              <p>One of the mandatories for the logo design was to have a mascot. Since Thai cuisine is Kinn Kinn’s focus, I researched about different animals and mythological creatures related to Thai culture. </p>
              <p>Once the top concepts were brought for review and the rationale behind each option was explained, it was the strong and reliable buffalo that became Kinn Kinn’s mascot, now lovably known as Buffy.</p>

              <h5 class="project-tags">Final Collateral</h5>
              <h2 class="project-subhead">From logo to merch design</h2>
              <p>Kinn Kinn’s social media assets included some brand elements and templates for the initial launch. The templates, when put together in a layout that resembled Instagram’s feed, turned out cohesive and quite poppy.</p>
              <p>Aside from the usual inclusions in a style guide—colours, typefaces, logo variations, etc.—photography art direction was also added. This way, the photographer would have a clearer vision for shooting the food photography later on.</p>

              <h2 class="project-subhead">Bringing a brand to life</h2>
              <p>This project taught me a lot about Thai culture during the initial research and ideation phase. It was also such a great experience working with a client who was on the other side of the world from me (there was a 16-hour time difference).</p>
              <p>Breathing life into my Kinn Kinn’s brand was an amazing opportunity. As I was compiling the style guide and bringing everything together at the end of this project, I remember the immense accomplishment and excitement before I sent it off for final approval. Seeing the venue, printed menu board, and merch was surreal—I hope to one day visit the location in person to enjoy a dish and see the designs for myself.</p>
